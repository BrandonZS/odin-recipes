    <h2>This is the best Pumpkin bread recipe ever!!</h2>
    <p>
        This chocolate chip pumpkin bread is one of the lightest, 
        moistest, most flavorful pumpkin breads ever, and probably 
        the easiest. Chocolate and pumpkin may sound like an odd pairing, 
        but that's only because you haven't had it—it works incredibly well 
        in this delicate quick bread.  
    </p>
    <p>
        I realize that chocolate and pumpkin might not sound like a great 
        pairing, but it really is! As long as you don’t use a too-sweet chip. 
        I’d avoid milk chocolate and think semi-sweet would be fine, but for me 
        the darker the better.

    <ul>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pumpkin seeds</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, combine pumpkin, white sugar, brown sugar, vegetable oil, milk, and eggs. Whisk together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture, and whisk in gently until the flour almost disappears. Stir in the chocolate chips and pumpkin seeds until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to transfer batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap the pan on the table a few times to bring air bubbles to the surface.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted near the center comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool in the pan about 45 minutes; remove to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
